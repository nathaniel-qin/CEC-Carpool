      <h1 class="bold centered">LIFE Fellowship is a Christian college fellowship.</h1>
      <h2 class="light centered">With church so far from where students typically live, we need a way to get people there. That's where carpool ministry comes in.</h2>

      <h3 class="regular" style="color: black;">Where does LIFE Fellowship meet?</h3>
      <h2 class="light padded-left" style="color: black;">We are affiliated with Chinese Evangelical Church of San Diego, located in Linda Vista, and this is where we gather for all of our regular meetings.</h2>
      <h3 class="regular big-top-margin" style="color: black;">What kind of people are in LIFE Fellowship?</h3>
      <h2 class="light padded-left" style="color: black;">LIFE is a group specifically for college students. We have members from UC San Diego, San Diego State University, and Point Loma Nazarene University.</h2>
      <h3 class="regular big-top-margin" style="color: black;">What are LIFE's regular meetings?</h3>
      <h2 class="light padded-left" style="color: black;">We have Friday night fellowship at 7:30pm on Fridays, Sunday School at 9:15am on Sundays, and Sunday worship service at 11:00am on Sundays at CEC. We also have weekly small groups, but we don't meet at CEC for these.</h2>
      <h3 class="regular big-top-margin" style="color: black;">Who's going to drive me?</h3>
      <h2 class="light padded-left" style="color: black;">All of our drivers are fellow students who are kind enough to sacrifice their time and gas to pick you up. Make sure to thank them!</h2>
      <h3 class="regular big-top-margin" style="color: black;">I still have some questions. Who can I ask?</h3>
      <h2 class="light padded-left" style="color: black;">If you have any questions, feel free to shoot us an email at ceclifecarpool@gmail.com and we'll try to help you out!</h2>
