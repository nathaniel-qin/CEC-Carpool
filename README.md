# CEC Carpool

A web-app for organizing carpools for CEC Life Fellowship.

## Usage

This functions as a stand-alone web-app, so there isn't really any need for you to clone this repository or install anything. Just go to the [github page](https://nathaniel-qin.github.io/CEC-Carpool/index.html) and play around with it!

Of course, you are welcome to clone this repository if you want to see my code, although it definitely is not written well. :)
